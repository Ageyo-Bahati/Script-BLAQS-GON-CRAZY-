<h3> Extended Fight Scene – "Jaymo vs. Shiro’s New Man"</h3>

<p><i>(Location: Inside the same bar where the courtroom is set up. Jaymo's got beef with **Kibandaski**, Shiro’s new man—a buff gym rat with a temper hotter than stolen ugali.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Kibandaski</strong>: (laughing) "You’re the clown who lost his girl to me? No wonder she came runnin'. Nigga, you look like you only fight with words."</p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "And you look like you got dropped as a baby. Relax, bro. Ain’t nobody scared of your biceps."</p> 

<p><i>(The crowd oooohs. Nyambura’s in the back, smirking but pretending not to care.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Kibandaski</strong>: (stepping forward) "You keep talkin' slick, and I’ll put you to sleep."</p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (shrugging) "You can try, but it won’t be the sleep you want, my guy. I fight dirty—like Nairobi public toilets."</p>

<p><i>(Before Kibandaski can react, Jaymo launches a bottle of Tusker beer right at his chest. BAM. Kibandaski stumbles back, furious.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Kibandaski</strong>: "Oh, it’s *on*, bitch!"</p> 

<p><i>(Kibandaski throws a wild punch. Jaymo ducks just in time, grabbing a chair and swinging it like a pro wrestler. The whole bar erupts into chaos. Chairs fly, bottles break, and someone in the back yells "WORLD WAR 3!")</i></p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (hiding under a table) "Jaymo, you crazy, bro! You tryna get us killed?!"</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (dodging punches) "Nigga, I been dead inside since my first breakup. Let’s go!"</p>

<p><i>(They brawl until the bartender breaks it up, waving a cricket bat.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: "Both of y’all get the fuck out before I break your skulls! Take this circus outside!"</p>

<h3>Messy Romance Scene – "Nyambura Plays With Jaymo's Head"</h3>

<p><i>(Location: Jaymo’s rooftop, overlooking the lake. It’s late at night, and Nyambura shows up uninvited, wearing one of Jaymo’s stolen hoodies. She's leaning against the railing, looking like trouble.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (annoyed) "What the fuck are you doin’ here, Nyambura? Thought we were done."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (grinning) "You say that every time, and yet here I am. You can’t quit me, and you know it."</p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (lighting a cigarette) "You’re like malaria, girl. Every time I think you gone, you come back worse."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (teasing) "And yet, you still want me. Admit it, Jaymo—you like this toxic shit."</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo smirks but doesn’t respond. Nyambura steps closer, brushing his arm with hers.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (softly) "We fight, we fuck, we fight again... What else you want from life?" </p>

<p><i>(She kisses him, slow and reckless. Jaymo knows he’s making a mistake, but he leans into it anyway, pulling her closer.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (muttering between kisses) "You’re gonna ruin me, Nyambura."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (smiling) "I already did, baby."</p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (nervously) "Uhh... ideas. You know, like... strategic solutions and... vibes?"</p> 

<p><i>(Wanja raises an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed. The waiter arrives with two plates of ugali and fish.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (trying to be smooth) "Ladies first. Go ahead, queen."</p> 

<p><i>(Wanja takes one look at the fish and wrinkles her nose.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Wanja</strong>: "Ew. I don’t do fish."</p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (panicking) "Shit... I thought you said you love fish on your Instagram bio?"</p>

<p><strong>Wanja</strong>: (deadpan) "That was a metaphor, dumbass."</p>

<p><i>(Pato freezes, realizing the night is a disaster. He tries to recover.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: "Look, babe—let’s not focus on the fish. What matters is... us."</p> 

<p><strong>Wanja</strong>: (rolling her eyes) "There is no ‘us,’ Pato. I just wanted free food."</p>

<p><i>(The waiter coughs awkwardly as Pato slumps in defeat.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (muttering) "Man, dating in this city is worse than COVID."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (grinning) "Oh, I got more than cash, old man."</p>

<p><i>(Before Baba Reggie can react, the door swings open—and in walks Jaymo, holding a crowbar with a devilish grin.)</i></p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "Surprise, motherfucker."</p>

<p><strong>Baba Reggie,</strong>: (furious) "Nyambura, you double-crossin' bitch!"</p>  

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (shrugging) "What can I say? Jaymo fights better—and kisses better, too."</p>

<p><i>(Baba Reggie lunges for his gun, but Jaymo’s faster. He cracks the crowbar down on the table, sending cash flying everywhere.)</i></p>
