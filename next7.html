<h3>Scene – “Cracks in the Plan”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: Jaymo’s apartment, early morning. Sunlight filters through cracked blinds. Nyambura lies on her stomach, scrolling her phone while Jaymo paces the room, shirtless and anxious.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "This Reggie thing ain’t over, babe. You know these kinda niggas—they don’t stay down."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (without looking up) "We got him in cuffs, though. What’s he gonna do, send us a love letter from jail?"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "Nah, just a hit squad."</p>

<p><i>(They laugh, but there’s tension underneath it. They both know this isn’t over.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Nyambura flips over and locks eyes with Jaymo.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (teasing) "You scared?" </p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (softly) "For you? Always."</p>

<p><i>(For a moment, the vulnerability between them is real. But just as quickly, Nyambura brushes it off, sitting up and lighting a cigarette.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (exhaling smoke) "Well, if shit hits the fan, we hit harder. Simple." </p>

<h3>Scene – “Plot Twist in Court”*</h3> 
<p><i>(Location: Kisumu Law Courts, a few days later. Nyambura sits confidently at the plaintiff's table, rocking a sleek blazer like it’s a fashion show. Jaymo sits beside her, leaning back in his seat like he owns the room. They think they’ve won the game—but the courtroom is about to get shaken up.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Judge Opondo walks in, banging his gavel. Everyone rises.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Judge Opondo</strong>: "Be seated."</

<p><i>(The defense lawyer stands—this time, it’s a new guy, slick as oil, with a grin that says trouble.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: "Your honor, new evidence has come to light. We request a delay in the proceedings."</p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (snapping) "What kind of bullshit is this?" </p>

<p><i>(The lawyer slides a folder across the table.)</i>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: (smirking) "Baba Reggie’s finances aren’t the only ones in question. Seems your clients here—Jaymo and Nyambura—aren’t exactly innocent angels."</p>

<p><i>(Nyambura’s eyes narrow as she opens the folder. Inside? Bank records—fake accounts, suspicious transactions, and names tied to them both.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (muttering) "What the fuck..." </p>

<p><i>(The judge bangs his gavel, silencing the murmurs in the room.)</i></p>  

<p><strong>Judge Opondo</strong>: "This court will reconvene in two days. I suggest you get your affairs in order." </p> 

<p><i>(The courtroom erupts in whispers as the session adjourns. Jaymo and Nyambura sit frozen, realizing someone set them up.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “Arguments on the Edge”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: Rooftop of the Courtroom Bar. The vibe is far from celebratory this time. Jaymo and Nyambura sit across from each other, tension thick between them. The city lights glitter in the distance.)</i></p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (angrily) "You didn’t tell me about those accounts." </p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (defensive) "And what? You think I opened them for fun? I did what I had to—same as you!"</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "Nah, nah, don’t pull that shit. If we get caught, we’re both going down hard."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (standing) "Then stop acting like some scared little boy! We’ve been in worse messes before!"</p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo grabs her arm, yanking her back.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (low, dangerous) "You better start telling me everything, Nyambura. No more secrets."</p>

<p><i>(She glares at him, but there’s fear in her eyes—fear of losing him, fear of getting caught, fear of everything crumbling.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (softly) "We were never supposed to make it this far, Jaymo."</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo lets go of her arm, running a hand through his hair.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (bitterly) "Yeah. And maybe that’s why we keep fucking it up." </p>

  <h3>Scene – “The Ambush”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: A back alley near the docks, midnight. Jaymo and Nyambura meet with Kano, hoping to figure out who set them up.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Kano</strong>: (nervous) "I told y’all—Reggie still got people on the outside. He’s pullin’ strings from behind bars."</p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (gritting her teeth) "Then we cut those strings. One by one." </p>

<p><i>(Before Kano can respond, headlights flash down the alley. A black SUV screeches to a halt, and masked men jump out with guns drawn.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "Shit! It’s a setup!"</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo grabs Nyambura, pulling her behind a stack of crates as gunfire erupts. Kano pulls out his pistol, firing back, but he’s outnumbered.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Jaymo grabs a bottle from the ground, smashes it, and hurls it at one of the attackers. It hits with a sickening crack, dropping the guy instantly.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (panting) "We gotta move—now!" </p>

<p><i>(They dash through the alley, dodging bullets, adrenaline pumping. Jaymo shoves Kano toward a side door, slamming it shut behind them.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Kano</strong>: (out of breath) "That was way too close." </p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (smirking) "Just another night in paradise."</p>

<h3>Scene – “The Big Decision”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: Safehouse in the outskirts of Kisumu. The trio sits around a flickering lamp, bruised and exhausted.)</i></p>  

<p><strong>Kano</strong>: "Look, we can’t keep running. We either hit back hard, or we disappear."</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (shaking his head) "We don’t run. Not from Reggie, not from anyone."</p>  

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (quietly) "We finish this. Once and for all." </p>

<p><i>(Jaymo looks at her, seeing the fire in her eyes—the same fire that made him fall for her in the first place.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "Ride or die?" </p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (grinning) "Always."

<h3>Scene – “The Final Courtroom Showdown”</h3>  
<p><i>(Location: Kisumu Law Courts. The last trial. Jaymo and Nyambura walk in like they own the place—confident, unbothered, and ready to burn it all down.)</i></p> 

<p><i>(Baba Reggie sits at the defense table, glaring at them with pure hatred. The air feels electric.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Judge Opondo</strong>: "This is the final hearing. Present your evidence."</p>  

<p><i>(Nyambura steps forward, holding a flash drive.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (smirking) "We got more than enough, your honor. Time to air out all the dirty laundry."</p>  

<p><i>(She plugs in the drive, and the courtroom projector flickers to life—bank transactions, audio recordings, and secret deals all linking Reggie’s crew to major crimes.)</i></p>

<p><i>(The courtroom gasps. Reggie’s face twists in rage.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Reggie</strong>: (yelling) "You think this is over?! I’ll come for you both!"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (smirking) "Not if we bury you first, bitch."</p>

<h3>Final Scene – “After the Storm”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: Rooftop of the Courtroom Bar, at sunset. Jaymo and Nyambura sit side by side, sipping whiskey and watching the city below.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "We really did it."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (grinning) "Told you. We always win."</p>

<p><i>(They clink glasses, lost in the moment. Toxic as ever—but free.)</i></p>
