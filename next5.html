<h3>Scene – “The Calm Before the Storm”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: Rooftop of the Courtroom Bar. Jaymo and Nyambura are still sitting there, sipping drinks, watching the Kisumu sunset fade into night. But the peace? Yeah, that shit ain't lasting.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (softly) "You know this can’t last, right?"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (shrugging) "So what? As long as it’s you and me, I don’t care."</p> 

<p><i>(Nyambura watches him for a moment, trying to figure out if he really means it. She knows they’re toxic—but damn, he makes her feel alive.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (smiling) "You stupid as hell."</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "And you love it."</p>

<p><i>(They kiss—soft and slow this time, like they’re trying to savor the rare moment of peace. But deep down, they both know it won’t last.)</i></p>

  <h3>Scene – “Unfinished Business”</h3>
  
<p><i>(Location: The docks at night. Jaymo and Nyambura pull up, meeting Kano for one final job—one last move to tie up their loose ends with Baba Reggie.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Kano</strong>: (nodding) "Aii, I respect y’all for handling Reggie last time. But you know the nigga ain’t dead."</p>  

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (coldly) "Yeah, well, he will be soon."</p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo shoots her a glance—she’s already talking like this is *their* war. He knows there’s no stopping her now.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "What’s the play, Kano?" </p>

<p><strong>Kano</strong>: "Simple. Tonight, we end it. For good. Reggie’s at that club on Obote Road. He don’t even know what’s comin’."</p>

<p><i>(Nyambura smirks. Jaymo clenches his jaw. The air feels heavy with tension.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Kano</strong>: (grinning) "Ride or die, right?"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (lighting a cigarette) "Always."</p>

<h3>Scene – “Club Showdown”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: The club on Obote Road. The music’s loud, the crowd is thick, and Baba Reggie is holding court at his VIP table, surrounded by his boys. He’s laughing, drinking—completely unaware of the storm headed his way.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Jaymo, Nyambura, and Kano walk in, dressed to kill. They move through the crowd like sharks—silent, deadly, and focused.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (whispering to Jaymo) "You ready?"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "I was born ready."</p>  

<p><i>(The three of them step into Reggie’s VIP area. The second Reggie spots Jaymo, his smile vanishes.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Baba Reggie</strong>: (snarling) "You got some fucking nerve showing up here, Jaymo."</p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (stepping forward) "We came to finish what you started, nigga."</p>

<p><i>(Before Reggie can react, Nyambura swings. Her punch lands square on his jaw, knocking him back into the couch. Chaos erupts.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “All-Out War”</h3>
<p><i>(It’s an all-out brawl in the VIP section—fists flying, bottles breaking, and bodies hitting the floor. Jaymo grabs a bottle of Hennessy and smashes it over one of Reggie’s boys. Kano tackles another dude to the ground, throwing punch after punch.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Meanwhile, Nyambura is in the center of the storm, fighting with the fury of someone who’s been through too much to lose now. Reggie swings at her, but she dodges and lands a knee to his ribs.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (laughing) "You slow as hell, old man!" </p>

<p><i>(Jaymo joins her, grabbing Reggie by the collar and slamming him against the wall.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (growling) "This is for everything you took from us."</p> 

<p><i>(He punches Reggie—once, twice—until the older man crumples to the ground. The fight ends as suddenly as it started, leaving Jaymo, Nyambura, and Kano standing over a broken Reggie.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “Aftermath”</h3>

<p><i>(The trio stumbles out of the club, bruised and bloody, but victorious. The streets of Kisumu are quiet, the night air heavy with the scent of lake water and adrenaline.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>*: (panting) "Shit... That was wild."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura </strong>: (grinning) "Told you." </p>

<p><i>(Jaymo pulls Nyambura close, kissing her forehead. They might be crazy, but they’re crazy *together*—and that’s all that matters.)</i></p>

  <h3>Scene – “Morning Regret”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: Jaymo’s apartment. The next morning, they wake up tangled in each other—bruised, exhausted, but alive. Jaymo rolls over, staring at Nyambura’s sleeping face.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (softly) "What the fuck am I doing?"</p>

<p><i>(Nyambura stirs, opening one eye.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (sleepily) "Makin’ bad decisions. But at least you’re doin’ it with me."</p>

<p><i>(They both laugh, knowing it’s true. They’re a mess—but they’re *each other’s* mess, and that’s all they need.)</i></p>

  <h3>Scene – “Forever Toxic: The Finale”</h3>  
<p><i>(Location: The rooftop of the Courtroom Bar, one last time. It’s sunset again, just like before—but this time, everything feels different.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (quietly) "You think we’ll ever get it right?"</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (smiling) "Probably not. But who the fuck cares?"</p>  

<p><i>(Nyambura leans against him, and they watch the city below—messy, chaotic, and beautiful. Just like them.)</i></p>

<p><i>(The camera zooms out slowly, leaving them on the rooftop as the sun dips below the horizon.)</i></p>
