<h3>Scene – “Why You Lying?”</h3>

<p><i>(Location: Back at Jaymo’s apartment. Nyambura is pacing the room, eyes blazing with fury. Jaymo is seated on the couch, phone in hand, looking calm—*too calm*.)</i></p>  

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "Who the fuck was that on your phone just now?"</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (rolling his eyes) "Relax, babe. It was just Shiro."</p> 

<p><i>(Boom. Wrong answer. The name "Shiro" is like gasoline on Nyambura’s short-ass fuse. She freezes for a second, processing what she just heard, then explodes.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "SHIRO?! Nigga, you *still* talking to that hoe after everything we been through?"</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (shrugs) "It ain't even like that, baby. She needed some help—"</p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (screaming) "HELP?! What the fuck, Jaymo? You Jesus now, healing the hoes of Kisumu?"</p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo laughs, which is a bad idea. Nyambura snatches the pillow off the couch and hurls it at his head. It misses, but her aim gets better when she’s mad.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (gritting her teeth) "Keep playing with me. I’ll burn this whole place down."</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (finally standing up) "You need to chill with all that psycho shit, Nyambura. Not every girl I talk to is competition."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (getting in his face) "Nigga, they all competition! You know what I been through—how dare you pull this *stupid* shit with me now?"</p>  

<p><i>(Jaymo grabs her by the wrists to calm her down, but Nyambura ain't calming down.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "Get your hands off me before I snap!"</p> 

<p><i>(He doesn’t let go. Instead, he pulls her closer until they’re nose-to-nose.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (low, dangerous) "Snap, then. I dare you." </p>

<p><i>(Their breathing is heavy, chests rising and falling like two animals about to pounce. There’s hate in Nyambura’s eyes, but there’s also desire—the kind of desire that only comes from loving someone *way too hard*.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (whispering) "You drive me fucking crazy."</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (smirking) "And you love it."</p>

<p><i>(The tension snaps—they crash into each other, kissing like they’re trying to punish each other with love. Clothes come off fast, hands everywhere, mouths gasping for air between every kiss.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “Next Morning Drama”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: Same apartment, but now it’s morning. Jaymo’s phone rings loudly, breaking the peaceful post-fight slumber. Nyambura stirs, eyes half-open, and sees the name **Shiro** flashing on the screen.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (softly) "This bitch..."</p>

<p><i>(She grabs Jaymo’s phone and answers it.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Shiro</strong>: "Hello? Jaymo?"</p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (grinning wickedly) "No, it’s Nyambura. What the fuck do you want?"</p> 

<p><i>(There’s stunned silence on the other end. Nyambura leans back on the pillows, feeling smug as hell.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Shiro</strong>: (nervous) "Uh... I— I just wanted to—"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (cutting her off) "Bitch, listen. Whatever you thought you had with Jaymo? Dead. So stay the fuck outta our business before I pull up and turn your life into a fucking nightmare."</p>  

<p><i>(She hangs up, throws the phone on Jaymo’s chest, and crosses her arms like a queen who just conquered a kingdom. Jaymo wakes up groggily, rubbing his eyes.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (confused) "What the fuck just happened?"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (smirking) "Handled it. You’re welcome."</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo just shakes his head, knowing there’s no winning with her—but damn, does he love the chaos.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “Ride or Die, Reloaded”</h3> 
<p><i>(Location: An abandoned warehouse by Lake Victoria. Jaymo and Nyambura are meeting with Baba Reggie’s rival, **Kano**. They need Kano’s help to settle a score—once and for all.)*</i></p> 

<p><strong>Kano</strong>: (leaning back, eyeing Nyambura) "You sure about this plan? Baba Reggie ain’t one to fuck with." </p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (lighting a cigarette) "Neither are we."</p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo watches her with a mix of pride and concern. He loves how fearless she is—but damn if it doesn’t scare him sometimes.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Kano</strong>: (grinning) "I like her. You got balls, Nyambura." </p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (blowing smoke) "No, nigga. I got brains. You in or not?"</p>

<p><i>(Kano chuckles, clearly impressed. He slaps the table, sealing the deal.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Kano</strong>: "Aii, let’s fuck shit up."</p>

<h3>Scene – “Car Chase Through Kisumu”</h3> 
<p><i>(Location: Kisumu streets, mid-afternoon. Jaymo and Nyambura are in a stolen car, being chased by Baba Reggie’s goons. Tires screech, engines roar, and gunshots echo through the narrow streets.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "You having fun yet?" </p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (laughing) "Hell yeah! Don’t fuck this up, Jaymo!"</p> 

<p><i>(They weave through traffic, narrowly avoiding a boda boda and skidding past the Kisumu market. Nyambura leans out the window, firing shots at the chasing car.)</i></p>  

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "These fools ain’t catching us!"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (yelling) "Hold on!" </p>

<p><i>(He swerves hard, sending the goon car crashing into a fruit stand. Mangoes and pineapples fly everywhere. The crowd cheers as Jaymo and Nyambura speed away, victorious.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “The Final Argument”</h3>

<p><i>(Location: Back at the courtroom bar. Jaymo and Nyambura are celebrating their win—but as always, it doesn’t take long for things to spiral.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (slamming her drink down) "I swear, if you ever text that bitch Shiro again, I’m out."</p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (laughing) "You been saying that for years, babe. You ain’t going nowhere."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (fuming) "Try me, nigga." </p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo leans in close, locking eyes with her.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (softly) "You love me too much to leave."</p>

<p><i>(Nyambura stares at him, breathing hard. She wants to slap him, kiss him, leave him, stay with him—everything all at once. This is the kind of love that burns, but damn if it doesn’t feel good.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (whispering) "Fuck you, Jaymo." </p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "You already did, baby."</p>

<p><i>(She bursts out laughing, and just like that, the storm passes. They kiss, the crowd cheers, and life goes on—messy, chaotic, and full of love.)</i></p>

<h3>Final Scene – “Forever Toxic” </h3>

<p><i>(Location: The rooftop of the courtroom bar, overlooking Lake Victoria at sunset. Jaymo and Nyambura sit side by side, sipping drinks and watching the city glow beneath them.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "We’re fucked up, aren’t we?"</p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (smiling) "Yeah. But at least we’re fucked up together."</p>

<p><i>(They clink their glasses, knowing that no matter what happens, they’ll always be ride-or-die.)</i></p>
