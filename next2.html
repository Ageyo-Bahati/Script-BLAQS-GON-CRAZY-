<h3>Scene – “Nyambura’s Confession” (Sh*t Gets Real)</h3>

<p><i>(Location: Sunset by Lake Victoria. Jaymo and Nyambura are sitting on the hood of a parked car, watching the water shimmer in the dying light. There’s a silence between them—charged, heavy, and dangerous.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (lighting a cigarette) "You always pull me back in, Nyambura. Like I’m some kind of idiot."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (softly) "Maybe... you just can’t help but love me."</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo blows out a cloud of smoke, watching it swirl in the air before the wind takes it.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "Loving you feels like holding fire in my hands. And I ain’t even mad about the burn."</p>

<p><i>(Nyambura shifts closer, her hand brushing against his thigh. There's something different about her tonight—less sharp, more vulnerable.)</i>

<p><i>Nyambura: (quietly) "I never planned any of this, Jaymo. Scamming you, playing you... it was supposed to be just a game."</i></p>  

<p><i>(Jaymo turns, looking her dead in the eyes.)</i></p>

<p><i>Jaymo: "Then what the fuck changed?"</i></p>

<p><i>*(She looks away, biting her lip.)</i> </p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (whispering) "You. You changed the whole fucking script."</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo feels his heart drop, and for once, the smooth-talking lawyer doesn’t know what to say. He tosses his cigarette and pulls her into a rough, desperate kiss. It's not pretty—it’s messy, raw, and real, like two people drowning and grabbing onto each other for air.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (murmuring against her lips) "We’re gonna burn everything down, aren’t we?"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (grinning) "Let’s burn, baby. Burn it all." </p>

<h3>The Betrayal (But Make It Hurt)</h3>  
<p><i>(Location: A rooftop party. Everyone’s vibing—Arbantone blaring, drinks flowing. Jaymo pulls up late, looking sharp, but as soon as he walks in, he spots Nyambura in the corner... with **Kibandaski**, the gym rat he fought earlier. And they’re looking a little *too* cozy.)*</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (storming over) "Nyambura, what the fuck is this?"</p>
<p><i>(Nyambura leans back, sipping her drink like she’s not causing world war three right now.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (coolly) "Relax, Jaymo. It's just a drink."</p> 

<p><strong>Kibandaski</strong>: (grinning) "Ain’t no law against havin' drinks, lawyer boy."</p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo sees red. In two seconds, he’s got Kibandaski pinned to the wall, fist cocked.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (growling) "Say that shit again, and I swear you won’t walk outta here." </p>

<p><i>(Nyambura laughs—a low, dangerous sound that sends chills down Jaymo’s spine.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "See? This is what I love about you, Jaymo. You act tough, but deep down, you’re just as messy as me."</p>  

<p><i>(Jaymo lets Kibandaski go, breathing hard, hands shaking. The betrayal cuts deep, but what hurts worse is the way Nyambura’s smile *almost* looks sad—like she wishes things could be different.)</i></p>

<h3>The “I Can’t Quit You” Scene (The Lovers Can’t Let Go)</h3>

<p><i>(Location: Jaymo’s apartment. It’s 2 a.m. Nyambura shows up, soaking wet from the rain, mascara running like the aftermath of a battle.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (opening the door, pissed) "What the fuck do you want, Nyambura? Haven't you caused enough damage?"</p>

<p><i>(Nyambura pushes past him, trembling but defiant.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "I know I’m poison, Jaymo. But you’re the only one who knows how to drink me without dying."</p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo stares at her, jaw clenched. Every logical part of his brain tells him to throw her out, but logic doesn’t mean shit when it comes to Nyambura.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (softly) "You’re gonna be the end of me, girl."</p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (whispering) "Then let’s end together."</p> 

<p><i>(The tension breaks. They crash into each other, kissing like two people on the edge of a cliff, knowing the fall is inevitable but loving the thrill anyway. Clothes hit the floor. The rain keeps pounding against the windows, but inside, everything burns.)</i></p>

<h3>The Chase Scene (Action On the Streets)</h3>

<p><i>(Location: Kisumu’s streets. Jaymo and Pato are in a battered Toyota, speeding through back alleys with **Baba Reggie’s thugs** hot on their tail. Nyambura is in the back seat, loading a stolen pistol.)</i></p>  

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (panicking) "Why the fuck do we always end up in these situations?!"</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "’Cause we’re dumb as shit, that’s why."</p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (calmly) "Less whining, more driving. I only got six bullets, and I’m not wasting any on your sorry ass, Pato." </p>

<p><i>(Jaymo whips the car around a corner, tires screeching. A thug leans out of the pursuing car, firing shots.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (yelling) "Duck, niggas!"</p> 

<p><i>(Nyambura rolls down the window and returns fire, shattering the windshield of the car behind them.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (grinning) "I told you—drama follows me everywhere."</p> 

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (terrified) "I swear, after this, I’m moving to fuckin’ Nakuru."</p>  

<p><i>(They speed toward the docks, the thugs still on their tail. The whole scene plays out like something out of *Fast and Furious*, but with more broken Swahili and cursing.)</i></p>

<h3>The Final Stand – “Love and War”</h3>  
<p><i>(Location: The docks. Jaymo, Nyambura, and Pato take cover behind crates as Baba Reggie and his men close in.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "Aight, this is it. No lawyers, no court. Just fists and bullets."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (smirking) "Sounds like my kinda party."</p>

<p><i>(The fight breaks out. It’s chaotic and brutal—Jaymo throwing punches, Nyambura taking shots like a sniper, and Pato somehow staying alive despite being utterly useless in combat.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Baba Reggie</strong>: (yelling) "You think you can fuck with me, Jaymo?! I own this city!"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "Not anymore, old man."</p>

<p><i>(In the final moments, Jaymo tackles Baba Reggie into the lake, sinking under the weight of their fight. Nyambura pulls him out just before he drowns, gasping for breath.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (softly) "You’re too stubborn to die, huh?" </p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (smirking) "And you’re too crazy to let me."</p>

<h3>The Closing Scene – A New Beginning </h3>

<p><i>(Location: The courtroom bar, rebuilt and busier than ever. Jaymo and Nyambura are back at it—arguing, flirting, and running their chaotic little empire together.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (teasing) "You still think you’re smarter than me, huh?"</p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "Nah. I just like the way you argue." </p>

<p><i>(They kiss, and the crowd cheers, because love, Kisumu-style, is messy, wild, and always unpredictable.)</i></p>
