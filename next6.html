<h3>Scene – “The Last Trial Before Chaos”</h3>  
<p><i>(Location: Kisumu Law Courts. It’s flashback time—we’re going back to the courtroom to understand where it all fell apart and why things went from legal to lethal. Jaymo and Nyambura are sitting in the defendant’s box, looking fresh but defiant. Baba Reggie is on the other side, smug as hell, with his lawyers stacked against them.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Judge Opondo</strong>: (sternly) "This is not a circus. I want order in my courtroom!" </p>

<p><i>(But the place is already on the edge of exploding. Reggie’s lawyer stands, adjusting his tie, ready to strike the final blow.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: "Your honor, it’s clear as day—Jaymo and Nyambura are nothing but lowlife criminals, involved in fraud, illegal dealings, and assault—"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (cutting in) "Watch your damn mouth, asshole!"</p> 

<p><i>(The judge bangs his gavel, but it’s too late. Nyambura’s out of her seat, fire in her eyes.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Judge Opondo</strong>: "Control yourself, or you’ll be held in contempt!"</p>  

<p><i>(Jaymo pulls Nyambura back down, whispering.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "Chill, babe. Not here." </p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (hissing) "I swear, I’m gonna slap that lawyer if he breathes wrong again." </p>

<p><i>(The court murmurs with tension. Baba Reggie smirks from across the room, knowing he’s got them cornered.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: (grinning) "I rest my case, your honor. Some people just belong in the streets."</p>

<p><i>(Nyambura lunges—but Jaymo grabs her just in time.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “The Explosion”</h3>

<p><i>(As the judge bangs the gavel again, chaos erupts. Baba Reggie whispers something to one of his boys sitting in the audience—and just like that, a full-blown *fight* breaks out inside the courtroom.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Jaymo and Nyambura dive into the chaos, fists flying. Jaymo tackles one of Reggie’s boys to the floor, and Nyambura lands a kick on another dude’s jaw. The courtroom transforms into a war zone.)</i></p>
<p><strong>Judge Opondo</strong>: (yelling) "I said ORDER!"</p>

<p><i>(But nobody’s listening. Cops storm in, trying to break up the brawl, but it’s too late—everything has fallen apart.)</i></p>  

<p><i>(Nyambura snatches a chair and swings it at Reggie, who barely dodges. Jaymo grabs the lawyer by his tie and slams him against the wall.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (growling) "Lowlife? Say that again, bitch!"</p>

<p><i>(By the time the dust settles, the courtroom looks like a hurricane hit it. Jaymo and Nyambura are hauled off in cuffs, grinning like maniacs.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “The Aftermath of the Court Blowout”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: Outside the courthouse, hours later. Jaymo and Nyambura are sitting on the steps, handcuffed, waiting to be processed. They look at each other—and start laughing.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (laughing) "We really did that, huh?"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "We always do."</p>  

<p><i>(Their lawyer storms out of the building, looking pissed.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: "You two just blew your case. You’re screwed."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (shrugging) "Better to go down swinging than take shit lying down."</p> 

<p><i>(The lawyer throws his hands up and walks away. Jaymo leans back, gazing up at the cloudy Kisumu sky, feeling oddly satisfied.)</i></p>

<h3>“The Comeback Plan”</h3>
<p><i>(Location: Back at Jaymo’s apartment. It’s late at night, and the chaos from earlier hasn’t settled yet. Jaymo and Nyambura lie tangled on the couch, cigarettes in hand, plotting their next move.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "Reggie won’t stop until we’re either locked up or buried, you know that, right?"</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (blowing out smoke) "Then we don’t give him the chance." </p>

<p><i>(They exchange a look—a silent agreement that the court battle is over, but the real war has just begun.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “The Court Drama Returns”</h3> 
<p><i>(Fast forward two months. Kisumu Law Courts. This time, Jaymo and Nyambura are *not* defendants—they’re plaintiffs. And they’ve come to finish what they started.)</i></p>

<p><i>(The courtroom is quieter now, but the tension is thick. Baba Reggie sits at the defense table, looking rattled for the first time. His legal team is scrambling, trying to keep up with the surprise lawsuit Jaymo and Nyambura have hit them with.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (smirking) "Look who’s squirming now."</p>

<p><i>(Their new lawyer stands confidently at the front, presenting evidence that turns the tables—money laundering, illegal land deals, and fraud. All of it traced back to Reggie.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: "Your honor, the evidence speaks for itself. Baba Reggie is the criminal here, not my clients."</p> 

<p><i>(Reggie glares at Jaymo and Nyambura, realizing he’s lost.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Judge Opondo</strong>: (banging the gavel) "This court finds Baba Reggie guilty on all charges."</p>

<p><i>(Nyambura leans in close to Jaymo, whispering with a grin.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "Told you we’d win."</p>

<h3>Scene – “Victory and Payback”</h3> 
<p><i>(Location: Outside the courthouse. Jaymo and Nyambura stand on the steps, watching as Reggie is led away in cuffs. The press surrounds them, cameras flashing.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: "How does it feel to finally get justice?"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "Feels damn good."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (laughing) "And we’re just getting started."</p>

<h3>Scene – “Forever Toxic, Forever Us”</h3> 
<p><i>(Later that night. The two of them are back on the rooftop of the Courtroom Bar, celebrating their victory. The city of Kisumu sprawls out below them, messy and beautiful.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "We really won, huh?"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: "We always win."</p>

<p><i>(They clink glasses, basking in the glow of their chaotic love and newfound freedom. Toxic? Yeah. But it works for them.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Jaymo pulls her close, kissing her like there’s no tomorrow. And maybe there isn’t—but they’ll burn bright as hell while they can.)</i></p>
