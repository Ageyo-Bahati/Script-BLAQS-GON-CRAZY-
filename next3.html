<h3>Scene – “Jealousy is a B*tch”</h3> 
<p><i>(Location: Another rooftop party, but this one’s bigger and wilder. Nyambura and Jaymo are trying to vibe, but the night ain’t going smoothly. A new girl, **Aisha**, keeps flirting with Jaymo—AND Nyambura is ready to cause a scene.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Aisha</strong>: (giggling) "Jaymo, you really a lawyer? Damn, you look more like a rapper."</p>

<p><i>(Aisha trails her finger down Jaymo’s arm. He chuckles awkwardly but glances toward Nyambura, who’s standing by the bar, sipping her drink and eyeing him like a hungry lioness.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (muttering) "You tryna get me killed out here?"</p>

<p><i>(Aisha laughs, clearly not understanding the ticking time bomb she’s playing with.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (yelling across the room) "Oi! Aisha, you tryna catch a fade tonight or what?"</p> 

<p><i>(The whole party falls silent. People love watching Nyambura blow up—it’s like front-row seats to a drama festival. Aisha smirks, like she’s not impressed.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Aisha</strong>: "Relax, mama. I’m just talkin’."</p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (storming over) "Yeah? Talk your way outta this, then."</p>  

<p><i>(Before Aisha can react, Nyambura slaps her drink right out of her hand. SPLASH. The glass shatters on the ground, and Jaymo knows sh*t just hit DEFCON 5.)*</i></p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning nervously) "Okay, okay, everybody chill—"  </p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (to Jaymo) "Chill?! Nigga, this your idea of fun? Entertaining random b*tches at a party like I’m invisible?" </p>

<p><i>(Aisha laughs, but she doesn't realize how dangerous that is.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (whirling back to Aisha) "You think this funny? You about to laugh through broken teeth, hoe."</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo grabs Nyambura by the waist just as she lunges for Aisha. Everyone’s yelling now, phones out, recording the chaos.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (to Nyambura) "Girl, you wildin’—this ain’t even worth it!"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (struggling against his grip) "Worth it?! Nigga, everything I do is for your sorry ass, and you out here tryna embarrass me?!"</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo knows she’s serious. If he doesn’t diffuse this, someone’s going to the ER.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (softly) "C’mon, baby. You know it’s just you. Always been you." </p>

<p><i>(That hits different. Nyambura softens—just a little. But not before throwing one last death glare at Aisha.)</i></p>  

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (muttering) "B*tch better leave before I change my mind." </p>

<p><i>(Aisha rolls her eyes and walks away, but the whole crowd knows who won this round.)</i></p>

<h3>Scene – “Make-Up Sex, Kisumu Style” </h3>

<p><i>(Location: Jaymo’s apartment, an hour after the fight. They stormed out of the party, yelling the whole way home. Now they’re standing in his living room, soaked in rain, chests heaving with rage and unresolved sexual tension.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (throwing his keys on the table) "You really had to start shit, huh? Can’t take you anywhere."</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (yelling) "Don’t act like you innocent! You let that bitch touch you—you think I didn’t see?" </p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (stepping closer) "What the fuck was I supposed to do? Punch her in the face?"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (sneering) "You shoulda done *something*, Jaymo. Or are you scared of every girl who bats her eyelashes at you?"</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo glares at her, and before he can stop himself, he grabs her by the waist and slams her against the wall. Nyambura gasps, but there’s fire in her eyes.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "You want me to fight for you? Fine. But don’t complain when I fight *with* you too." </p>

<p><i>(Nyambura laughs—a dangerous, breathless sound. She grabs his collar, pulling him closer.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (whispering) "Fight me all you want, baby. Just don’t ever leave me."</p>

<p><i>(They crash into each other, kissing like two storms colliding. It’s messy—teeth clashing, hands everywhere, clothes hitting the floor in record time. There’s nothing gentle about it. This is love born out of chaos, and neither of them would have it any other way.)</i></p>

  <h3>Scene – “Pato’s Intervention”</h3>
  
<p><i>(Location: Jaymo’s apartment, next morning. Pato shows up unannounced, looking exhausted and carrying a bag of mandazi.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (walking in) "Yo, you two alive in here, or y’all kill each other?"</p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo, shirtless and looking half-dead, stumbles out of the bedroom. Nyambura is still asleep, tangled in the sheets like a queen who just conquered a kingdom.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "Barely, nigga."</p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (shaking his head) "You two the most toxic people I know, I swear. But y’all make it look... kinda fun."</p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo chuckles, grabbing a mandazi and sitting down.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "Ain’t love supposed to be a little dangerous?"</p>  

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (laughing) "Dangerous? Nigga, this shit’s a war zone!"</p> 

<p><i>(Nyambura stirs in bed, mumbling something in her sleep.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (half-asleep) "Tell Pato to shut up."</p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (grinning) "See? Even in her sleep, she’s toxic."</p>

<h3>Scene – “Ride or Die”</h3>

<p><i>(Location: A back alley. Jaymo and Nyambura are waiting in Jaymo’s car, planning their next move. They’ve got one last score to settle—Baba Reggie owes them, and tonight, they’re taking what’s theirs.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (loading a pistol) "You ready for this?"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "Baby, I was born ready."</p>  

<p><i>(They exchange a glance, the kind that says *no matter what happens, we got each other*. Jaymo leans over and kisses her, slow and deliberate, like it might be the last time.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (smirking) "If we die tonight, at least we go out in style."</p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (starting the car) "Nah. We don’t die. We win."</p>

<p><i>(They peel out of the alley, ready to raise hell one last time.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Location: The docks. Jaymo and Nyambura roll up like Bonnie and Clyde, armed and dangerous. Baba Reggie’s men try to surround them, but these two ain’t going down without a fight.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (to Nyambura) "You cover me. I’ll handle Reggie."</p>  

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (grinning) "You better not get shot. I don’t got time to mourn your dumb ass."</p>

<p><i>(The fight breaks out—gunshots, fists flying, pure chaos. But Jaymo and Nyambura fight like a well-oiled machine. Baba Reggie doesn’t stand a chance.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Baba Reggie</strong>: (coughing, on the ground) "Y’all think you won?"</p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "Nah. We *know* we did."</p>

<p><i>(Jaymo and Nyambura walk away from the carnage, hand in hand, ready to take on whatever comes next.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (grinning) "Always mad, baby. But that’s why you love me."</p>

<p><i>(They kiss, the crowd cheers, and the music kicks in. Love, drama, and chaos—this is how legends are made in Kisumu.)</i></p>
