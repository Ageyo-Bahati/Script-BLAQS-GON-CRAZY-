    <h3>Extended Scene 1 – “The Side-Chick Situation”</h3>
    
<p><i>(Location: Inside the court. A jilted girlfriend, *Winnie*, drags her boyfriend *Timo*into Jaymo’s “court” after catching him with another woman.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (grinning) "Aight, calm down. You bringin’ your relationship to *me* means it’s already fucked up. What’s the story?"</p> 

<p><strong>Winnie</strong>: (fuming) "This dumbass was out at Dunga Beach with a side-chick. *My* man eatin’ fish with another bitch?! Nah, that’s where I draw the line."</p>

<p><strong>Timo</strong>: (shrugging) "First of all, Winnie—relax. It wasn’t even like that."</p> 

<p><strong>Winnie</strong>: (furious) "Like what, Timo? Like what?! You had your hands all over that bitch. Ain’t no way you accidentally end up at the beach with someone in a bikini!"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (laughing) "Man, I gotta hear this excuse. Timo, tell me: how do you ‘accidentally’ end up with another woman?"</p>

<p><strong>Timo</strong>: (sweating) "I mean… we was just chillin’, vibin’. It wasn’t even serious. Just some casual… friendship shit, you know?" </p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (shaking her head) "Nigga, please. Friends don’t take their clothes off by the lake. Try harder."  </p>

<p><i>(The crowd howls with laughter, and Winnie looks like she’s two seconds from exploding.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Winnie</strong>: "Jaymo, I want *everything* from this clown—his hoodie, his PlayStation, even those fake-ass Yeezys. He playin’ me? Now I’m playin’ him!" </p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (to Timo) "Man, you better pay up before she repossesses your whole life." </p>

<p><strong>Timo</strong>: "C’mon, Winnie, let’s talk about this!" </p>

<p><strong>Winnie</strong>: (grinning) "Too late, motherfucker. I’m takin’ it all!"

  <h3>Extended Romantic Drama – "Jaymo and Nyambura Clash"</h3>
  
<p><i>(Location: Jaymo’s apartment. It’s late, and Jaymo and Nyambura are arguing after Nyambura finds out Jaymo’s been flirting with Shiro, the waitress.)</i></p> 

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (pissed) "So you out here sweet-talking Shiro like I’m just some side piece? What the fuck, Jaymo?!"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (defensive) "It wasn’t even like that! Damn, Nyambura, you blowin’ shit way outta proportion."</p>  

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (voice rising) "Nigga, proportion?! You were out there touchin’ her hand like you tryna propose! Don’t play dumb with me."</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (frustrated) "I swear it wasn’t nothin'. Can’t a nigga even talk to a woman without catchin' a case?"</p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (furious) "You can *talk*, Jaymo. What you *can’t* do is make me feel like a clown. Fuck you and your little excuses!"</p> 

<p><i>(Jaymo steps closer, voice low, trying to calm her down.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: "Look, Nyambura... I only got space for one crazy girl in my life—and it’s you."</p> 

<p><i>(For a moment, they stare at each other, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. Then, suddenly, Nyambura yanks Jaymo’s collar, pulling him into a rough kiss.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Nyambura</strong>: (breathlessly) "You better keep it that way, nigga."

<p><strong>Thug #1</strong>: (smirking) "What’s good now, lawyer boy? You think talkin’ slick in court makes you tough on the street?"</p>

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (rolling his neck) "Man, I thought y’all were gonna move on. Guess some niggas just can’t take an L."</p>  

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (nervous) "Jaymo, maybe we should—"</p> 

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (cutting him off) "Fuck that. If they want smoke, let’s give 'em the whole pack."</p>

<p><i>(The thugs lunge. Fists fly. Jaymo dodges a punch and slams one thug into a wall. Meanwhile, Pato throws wild, sloppy punches—most of which miss.)</i></p>

<p><strong>Pato</strong>: (panting) "Jaymo! I’m fightin’ for my *life* out here!"</p>  

<p><strong>Jaymo</strong>: (laughing) "Nigga, you fightin' like you underwater. Get it together!" </p>

<p><i>(Jaymo lands a clean uppercut on one thug, dropping him cold. Pato, somehow, manages to trip another guy with pure luck.)</i></p>
